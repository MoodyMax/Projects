1. git branch [branch name]
2. Fast forward Merge is when git knows the order of commits chronologically and can 'put' one set on top the other.
   Recersive Merge is when git uses an algorith to merge branches when the fast-forward merge won't suffice.
3. git checkout [branch name]
4. git branch -d [branch name]
5. If changes were made on both branches before the merge. Git doesn't know which to keep and which to overwrite.
